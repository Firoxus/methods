Hey epic, I had a problem with my account recently and was hoping you guys could help. I recently got logged out of my account  with the message "login expired  or logged in elsewhere" later my friend told me I was getting logged out from a different console. I then realised there was a Nintendo switch connected that wasn't connected by me. I tried disconnecting this platform, but it told me I had to verify my email first which the email created was a  school email that was deleted about a year ago. was hoping you guys could help me with this by maybe changing my email the epic name is Prime NinjaPrime
