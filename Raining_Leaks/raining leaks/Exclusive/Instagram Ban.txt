Instagram account b@n method

Account must have a few violations, but you don't have to (pictures/videos/stories/comments) 2-6 are good. Then you report it like this:

1x su!c!de
2x hate speech
3x dr!gs

Best with an older account, for example 2018 with old support.

Then 1x su!c!de with 2012/2013 USA VPN

And an hour or two later with the other account you reported with 1x spam (without VPN)

Optionally you tell as many as possible that they should also report 1x spam.
